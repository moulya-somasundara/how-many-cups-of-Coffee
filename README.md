# how-many-cups-of-Coffee

This program has three functions: 
 1. First function will calculate the sum of the squares of 3 numbers and return that result.
 2. Second function will make a simple function that uses console.log to print hello to someone!
 3. Third function will create and return a simple song called 99 Cups of Coffee on the Desk.
    The lyrics of this song grow longer depending on how many cups of coffee there are on the desk.
    For instance if you run cupofcoffee(5) it will return:
    
    5 cups of coffee on the desk! 5 cups of coffee! 
Pick one up, drink the cup, 4 cups of coffee on the desk!

4 cups of coffee on the desk! 4 cups of coffee! 
Pick one up, drink the cup, 3 cups of coffee on the desk!

3 cups of coffee on the desk! 3 cups of coffee! 
Pick one up, drink the cup, 2 cups of coffee on the desk!

2 cups of coffee on the desk! 2 cups of coffee! 
Pick one up, drink the cup, 1 cup of coffee on the desk!

1 cup of coffee on the desk! 1 cup of coffee! 
Pick it up, drink the cup, no more coffee left on the desk!
